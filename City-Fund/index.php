By 2017, we plan to double the number of high quality charter school seats in DC, while shrinking the number of underperforming charter schools.

<p>Danielle did not speak English or understand the customs of her new environment and recalled feeling "like an exotic animal at the zoo." But she had a deeply-held belief that if she worked her hardest, life would get better.</p>

<p><span class="capWord">DC Prep</span> was just the place for Danielle to flourish. Providing an excellent education for underserved students, DC Prep Edgewood Middle Campus is the highest-performing public charter school in the city.</p>

<p>Now a junior in high school, Danielle earns outstanding grades and speaks flawless English, while maintaining a deep love of her native French. She even finds time to tutor struggling young readers. Danielle tutors DaQ'an, helping him decipher the mystery of words and serving as a trustworthy friend. To DaQ'an, Danielle is a rockstar.</p>

<p>The solid start Danielle received at DC Prep turned the challenges of her childhood into opportunities.</p>
